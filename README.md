# RabbitMQ_Message_Passing
This project was for the final in my CS-4320 class at The University of Missouri. It was meant for using message passing architecture in order to "scale-out" rather than "scale-up". This code receives a message from a host queue, computes the result of the first step, and then pushes the result to a second queue to compute the final result.
